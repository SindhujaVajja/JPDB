(This is my first repository on JsonPowerDB IML and IRL commands
Kindly let me know if the code can be improved.)

#JsonPowerDB IML and IRL API commands implementation 

Description:
  This project is about the basics of JPDB API Commands and how to implement and use them in projects. Here I tried implementing and using IML - Index Manipulation Language (4 commands) and IRL - Index Retrieval Language (21 commands).

About JsonPowerDB: 
  JsonPowerDB(JPDB) is a high performance, light weight, Ajax enabled, simple to use, real-time, creative and disruptive multimode and In-Memory database. It supports and features Document Oriented, RDBMS, Key-Value pair, Caching, GEOSpatial and Time-series REST API which is ready to be used by almost all technology platforms. It is one of the fastest and most secured databases of present time as it is built on top of one of the fastest and real-time data indexing engines - PowerIndeX.


Benefits of using JsonPowerDB:
It is serverless and schema-free.
It is simple to use and very easy to interact with JPDB.
It allows querying multiple databases which is as simple and fast as querying on single database.
It minimizes time to market, reduces Development and Maintenance cost, lowers the Total cost of Ownership.
It is A Database SAAS - available as shared environment or as independent server on Internet / Intranet / Extranet / Cloud.
It has ready to use JsonPowerDB API which makes the work efficient and effective.
Latest 2020 release contains a powerful JavaScript tool JPDBObject.js to synchronize the JsonPowerDB database in real time for client applications.
